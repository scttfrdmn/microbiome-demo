# Pipeline Fix Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to address the pipeline failure issues, specifically focusing on the JSON processing errors and division by zero problems identified in our debug analysis.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Division by Zero in Per-Sample Cost Calculation**
   - Fixed in `dashboard/data/update_data.sh`
   - Added explicit check for `COMPLETED_SAMPLES` being zero before division
   - Provided default value of "0.025" when no samples are completed

2. **Invalid Taxonomy Normalization**
   - Fixed in `dashboard/data/update_data.sh`
   - Added check for when sum of taxonomy values is too small
   - Provided sensible default values to prevent division by zero

3. **Resource Utilization Calculation Errors**
   - Fixed in `dashboard/data/update_data.sh`
   - Added validation for CPU, memory, and GPU values
   - Added error handling for all bc calculations
   - Provided fallback values when calculations fail

4. **JSON Processing Failures**
   - Fixed in `dashboard/data/update_data.sh`
   - Added robust error handling around all jq operations
   - Created fallback mechanism to generate valid JSON when parsing fails
   - Added automatic recovery with fresh data structure when needed

5. **Continuous Update Script Resilience**
   - Fixed in `continuous_data_update.sh`
   - Added error handling around the copy_data_to_dashboard.sh call
   - Ensured the script continues running despite errors to allow recovery

6. **FAILED Status Handling**
   - Fixed in `copy_data_to_dashboard.sh`
   - Added special handling for FAILED status
   - Treated FAILED like INITIALIZING for data setup but maintained FAILED status
   - Prevented cycling between FAILED and loading pipeline

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes:

1. Run the pipeline with empty initial data to test division by zero protections
2. Intentionally introduce invalid JSON to test error recovery
3. Test the dashboard with each pipeline state (INITIALIZING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
4. Verify that the dashboard doesn't cycle when pipeline status is FAILED

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive JSON validation before processing
2. Implement central error logging for better debugging
3. Add state validation to ensure consistent pipeline status
4. Add automated recovery for corrupted data files
