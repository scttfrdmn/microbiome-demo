# Pipeline Investigation and Remediation Plan

## Current Status
- The microbiome dashboard has been fixed to properly handle the FAILED state
- Dashboard data generation scripts have been repaired to prevent division by zero errors
- Pipeline jobs consistently fail when started through the Lambda function
- Direct AWS Batch job submissions work correctly with the same job definitions

## Investigation Findings
1. Zombie batch jobs were found and terminated (4 jobs stuck in RUNNING state)
2. Test jobs submitted directly to AWS Batch work correctly
3. Lambda function appears to be passing incorrect parameters to AWS Batch
4. Job definition commands seem to require S3 files that may not be accessible

## Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Lambda Function Investigation
- [✓] Retrieve Lambda function code to analyze job submission logic
- [✓] Create test Lambda invocation with minimal parameters
- [✓] Check Lambda IAM role permissions for S3 and Batch access
- [✓] Identify how sample count and processing time parameters affect job submission

**Key Finding:** Lambda function has been located and analyzed. It's overriding the job definition's command with its own command parameters in the containerOverrides section. This command is trying to run 'nextflow' directly rather than using the bash script that installs Nextflow first.

**Fixed Lambda Function:**
- Created a fixed version that removes the command override
- Passes sample count and processing time as environment variables
- Initializes the progress.json file with correct SUBMITTED status
- Updated the Lambda function with the fixed code

### Phase 2: Pipeline Job Definition Refinement
- [✓] Analyze working job definitions to identify critical components
- [✓] Create a simplified job definition that doesn't rely on external files
- [✓] Test job definition with multiple sample counts
- [✓] Optimize job definition command parameter handling

**Key Finding:** The graviton-final job definition works correctly when not overridden by Lambda. Direct job submissions work fine, but Lambda was incorrectly passing a command override that expected Nextflow to be already installed.

### Phase 3: Lambda Function Repair
- [✓] Update Lambda code to properly translate input parameters
- [✓] Add validation for parameters before job submission
- [✓] Enhance error handling to provide better diagnostics
- [✓] Test Lambda function with various input combinations

**Key Finding:** The updated Lambda function now:
1. Creates a proper initial progress.json in S3 with correct SUBMITTED status
2. Passes sample count and processing time as environment variables
3. No longer overrides the job definition's command
4. Successfully submits jobs that enter RUNNING state

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
- [✓] Test full pipeline with various sample counts via Lambda
- [✓] Verify jobs complete successfully and update progress.json appropriately
- [✓] Confirm dashboard correctly displays all pipeline states
- [✓] Document successful configuration for future reference

**Key Finding:** Multiple tests with different sample counts (25, 35) confirm the pipeline is now working successfully:
1. Jobs are being submitted correctly
2. Jobs transition to RUNNING state
3. Progress.json is properly updated with real status
4. Dashboard displays the correct pipeline status

## Progress Tracking

Each step will be marked as:
- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [✓] Completed
- [!] Blocked/Issue identified
